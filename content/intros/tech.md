title: "Moriel Schottlender: Technically Funny"
---

I'm a Software Engineer that takes **Team Standup** to the next level.

I am with you in the trenches tracking a bug with git blame just to discover **it's my code**.

I'm the one that **wrote the code** that you're debugging right now.

And Tech can be **technically funny.**
