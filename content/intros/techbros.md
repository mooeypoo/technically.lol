I'm a **10x Software Engineer** that exposes the system by WTFing it.

Hey, my joke blockchain lineup is like **crypto for Musk**, laugh-ensured with **Typescript level validation**.

It's so unicorn stellar, there's no need for **pre-deployment QA**, bugs are reported in <code>prod</code>

.. and I totally [shipped this website](https://github.com/mooeypoo/technically.lol/).
