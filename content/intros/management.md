title: "Moriel Schottlender: Technically Funny"
---

I'm Moriel from Engineering. I practice comedy for my **professional development** time.

My shows increase **employee satisfaction**, without spending RSUs or giving away promotions.

I am a **woman** who's part of the **LGBTQ+** and **neurodivergence** groups, so by bringing me to your company, you can tick off the **DEI quota** for the quarter!
