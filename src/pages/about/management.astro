		I'm Moriel from Engineering. I practice comedy for my <span class="rainbow">professional development</span> time.
	</p>
	<p>My shows increase <span class="rainbow">employee satisfaction</span>, without spending RSUs or giving away promotions.
	</p>
  <p>I am a <span class="rainbow">woman</span> who's part of the <span class="rainbow">LGBTQ+</span> and <span class="rainbow">neurodivergence</span> groups, so by bringing me to your company, you can tick off the <span class="rainbow">DEI quota for the quarter</span>!</p>
